# NaaandezBot
Discord Bot that replies to some custom commands. Made to have fun with the Discord API.

## Requirements
`python >=3.7`

## Installation
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Create a Discord Bot [following these instructions](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#discord-intro), then place your bot's token on a new file called `.env` like follows:

```BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE```

Finally, run `python main.py` and you're all set up!

### Note
To use the Google Calendar functionality, you would have to obtain your `credentials.json` from the Google Developer's Console ([see here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python)) and place it in the `config` folder.

## Commands
Various commands are included within the bot. All prefixes support the `help` directive, which inform the user how to use a given command.

### Piru
Commands that start with `!piru` prefix make the bot reply with cat ASCII art according to each mood passed in as argument:
* `!piru play`
* `!piru sleep`
* `!piru alert`
* `!piru stare`
* `!piru love`

### Wave
The `!wave` command makes the bot expect the 'ðŸ‘‹' emoji from the user before 15 seconds are up. If done successfully, you would make the bot happy. If not, the bot would be angry at you.

### Rekt
The `!rekt` command returns a spoiler-marked image of our lord and saviour, Gino.

### Google Calendar Events
Commands that start with `!cal` prefix make the bot reply with the events from a particular Gmail account linked to the `credentials.json` file. Can be formatted as an ASCII calendar or as a simple list.
* `!cal events`
* `!cal view`

## Disclaimers
Only has been tested on a MacBookPro running macOS Catalina Version 10.15.7. You may have to install SSL Certificates manually on the machine where the bot is being run ([see this issue](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/issues/423), which I've solved with `sudo path/to/Install\ Certificates.command`).
